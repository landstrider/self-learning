//For a tree with nodes numbered in natural number system and height(H) of tree numbered in whole number system with root numbered 1 and height at root is also 0, in a level order traversl fashion:
//	Nodes at a given level 'h' = 2^h
//	Start Node at level 'h' = 2^h
//	End Node at level 'h' = 2^(h + 1) - 1
//	Middle Left Element from a Node (numbered n) in the Next level = N * 2
//	Middle Right Element from a Node (numbered n) in the next level = N * 2 + 1
//
